    <h1>My Favourite Place Is Disneyland!</h1>

    <div id="p">My favourite place is Disneyland . When you go there you will feel like you are in a dream world . There are two theme parks I have visited . One is Disneyland Park and the other one is Adventure Park. In Walt Disneyland you can meet many famous disney characters such as Mickey Mouse , Minnie Mouse , Donald Duck , Daisy Duck etc. You can also go on many rides like alice in wonderland game etc . There are many resturants to eat at as well . There is a very big castle were all the characters do many performances . In the Adventure park you get to go to Mickie mouses house! I went in there and I even met Mickie! You can also go on many rides . There are 3 lands to visit here like Cars land , Bug land and one more land which is a surprise! I hope you got a picture in your mind of Disneyland but if not you can see some pics of Disneyland Below . Your Friend ... Aahana.</div>
